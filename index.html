                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Jorens. I'm a full stack web developer from Latvia with 4 years
                    of professional experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a web developer with a mindset of an entrepreneur. I view
                    my job more than just writing code. I try to help and support
                    my clients in any way I can; When appropriate, I will take
                    initiative, offer suggestions and alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although my main trade is web development, I have skills that
                    stretch beyond that as well, skills such as marketing, UX, product
                    design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am very easy to work with - I am communicative, honest and
                    responsive. I always try to keep my clients in the loop as much 
                    as possible (without being a bother)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have several areas of focus, although my work is not limited to just
                    those and I'm always open to exploring new ones.

                        rests is scalable, extensible, optimized and
                        cost-effective, and that different parts of
                        the system interact seamlessly.

                    <li>
                        <b>Infrastructure</b> - ensuring that the tools
                        and platforms used for running the project
                        are best suited for the use-case and work

                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>
                    As a developer, I have several principles that I follow when
                    writing code and designing systems, namely:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Team code</b> - I write code that is readable, well-documented and logical
                        in the context of collaborating with other developers (even when working by myself),
                        both for the given moment and for the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Independent, reusable code</b> - I favor abstract code that is not coupled
                        to a particular third-party framework, platform or library, which makes
                        migration to a different one, metaphorically speaking nearly as simple as
                        pressing a button, without needing to rewrite much or anything at all.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Extensible code</b> - I write code that is easy to extend, focusing
                        on making it easy to add new lines and making it unnecessary to rewrite
                        existing ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fast code</b> - I write code that is optimized for 
                        time-to-first-(byte, interaction, request, response, load), in other
                        words reducing the time spent just waiting for the software to finish
                        its task, without the expense of other features like readability or
                        extensibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Scalable code</b> - I write code that is fundamentally designed
                        to work well and without friction in large complex systems, favoring
                        a modular approach.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My proccess</h2>
                <p>
                    When I work on projects and/or with clients, my workflow is Agile-like
                    and typically consists of a flexible/open-ended cycle composed of the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Define feature/task/milestone/goal/project</b> - A client might request
                        for a task to be done by me, at which point I either clarify requirements
                        if they are not clear enough and/or offer suggestions/alternatives before
                        moving onto the next step
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Define an abstract design for feature and plan of action towards fulfilling it</b> -
                        At this point I "blueprint" the base/core of the feature or task, defining
                        the core characteristics, potential room for variation, make sure that I have everything I need to get it done,
                        and defining a clear picture of how to achieve it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Develop an MVP of the feature based on the abstract design</b> - Develop an
                        MVP of the feature, something that outlines the core characteristics of the feature
                        while also making it easy to customize the feature for revision or future changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Receive feedback</b> - Collect and analyze feedback/criticism from the client
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Iterate or move on to the next task</b> - If the client is satisfied with
                        the outcome, move onto the next task. If changes are requested, re-iterate until
                        expected outcome is achieved.
                    </li>
