                In this project I was tasked with developing a couple of elements for the product page.
                I did this by custom coding Elementor widgets. All elements that you can see in the pictures
                are custom coded Elementor widgets that I wrote myself. <br>
                Additionally, for this website, I wrote an internal plugin that allows
                the client to bulk import WooCommerce products and product variations from a CSV.
