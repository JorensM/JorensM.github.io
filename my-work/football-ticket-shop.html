            In this project I was tasked with developing a couple of elements for the product page.
            I did this by custom coding Elementor widgets. All elements that you can see in the pictures
            are custom coded Elementor widgets that I wrote myself. <br>
            Additionally, for this website, I wrote an internal plugin that allows
            the client to bulk import WooCommerce products and product variations from a CSV.
