                Bookibo is an appointment booking platform. It supports various features such as tracking
                clients, booking appointments, managing multiple venues and personnel.

                In this project I was the frontend developer. I was responsible for implementing (and
                sometimes designing) various UI elements and integrating them with the web appâ€™s backend
                API. I was also responsible for implementing unit and end-to-end tests for the frontend,
                which I did using Playwright. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The web app is built using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.
                Some parts of the web app used Tailwind UI components, which I had to implement
                functionality for myself since they do not have functionality by default.
